# Carlos Branding

This folder contains various branding assets for Carlos, including logos, icons, and 
other images.

To reduce duplication, many of the assets in this folder are shared across the 
repository using symbolic links.

It also contains the [`carlos.css`](./carlos.css) stylesheet, which is used to style 
any front-end components that are part of the Carlos project.
